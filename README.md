This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The bug.java file shows an example of this error where an array is accessed beyond its bounds, resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bugSolution.java file shows the corrected code with the loop condition changed to avoid this error. This is a simple example to illustrate a frequent source of error in array processing.  Be mindful of your loop conditions and array boundaries when working with arrays in Java.
